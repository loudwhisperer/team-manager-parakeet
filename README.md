# team-manager-parakeet

## Description

The usage of The Team Manager Parakeet application is to give someone in charge of managing an employee database an easy way to keep track of departments, roles and employees in each in a simple to use terminal application that can be updated with new values for each category and the corresponding values there-in so we can just go look and update these tables with ease.

The lesson here that really stuck with me was that traversing sql databases can be a little difficult but once its understood how tables connect and the individual columns in each get selected the process just becomes a bit of rinse and repeat but that said I have a lot more respect for folks managing very large databases and keeping track of all that.

## Installation

- To install The Team Manager Parakeet application simply pull the SSH Link from the bright green code button in GitHub.
- Open up your terminal on your local machine and naviage to a directory you would like to store the code for this in type git clone then paste the SSH Link and hit enter.
- Once done you will have the full repo then it is just a matter of changing directories to The Team Manager Parakeet application and using your preffered method for opening it in a code editor.
